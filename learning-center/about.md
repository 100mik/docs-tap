# Learning Center for VMware Tanzu Application Platform <!-- omit in toc -->

## Overview
The Learning Center is designed to provide a platform for hosting workshops. Although Learning Center requires
Kubernetes to run, and is being used to teach users about Kubernetes, it could also be used to host training for other
purposes as well. It may for example be used to help train users in web based applications, use of databases, or
programming languages, where the user has no interest or need for Kubernetes.
