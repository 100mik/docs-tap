# Getting started with Learning Center

To view information and usages for Learning Center, see [About Learning Center](../about-learning-center/about-learning-center.md).
Before you can start deploying workshops, you need to install a Kubernetes operator for Learning Center.
The operator manages the setup of the environment for each workshop and deploys instances of a workshop for each person.
