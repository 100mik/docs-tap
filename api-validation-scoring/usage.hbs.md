## Use API Validation and Scoring to score an auto-registered API

This topic describes how an [Auto Registered API](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.3/tap/GUID-api-auto-registration-about.html) is scored.

Refer [API Auto Registration usage](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.3/tap/GUID-api-auto-registration-usage.html) to deploy the workload. Navigate to the TAP GUI to view the API .

The Overview Tab of your API in TAP GUI will now show the API scores.
