# API Validation and Scoring

This specific feature of API Validation and Scoring focuses on scanning and validating an OpenAPI specification. The API Specification is generated from the [API Auto Registration](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Application-Platform/1.3/tap/GUID-api-auto-registration-about.html) feature in TAP. Once an API is registered, the API Specification goes through static scan analysis and is validated. Based on the validation, a scoring is provided that indicates to  developers / DevOps, the quality and health of their API Specification as it relates to Documentation, OpenAPI best practices, and Security. There is a Validation Analysis card  on the API Overview page on the TAP GUI that displays the summary of the scores. If the user wants to get more details of the scores, they can click on the 'More Details' link and can get a detailed view.

The solution helps developers ensure that their APIs are more secure and robust, by providing feedback and recommendations early on in the software development lifecycle. Based on the feedback and recommendations, the developers can modify their API Specifications and improve their scores, and hence improve the posture of their APIs. The solution also helps  DevOps / DevSecOps understand how well the APIs have been implemented.
