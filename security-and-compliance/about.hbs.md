# Security and compliance

Security is the foremost concern of Tanzu Application Platform. Learn more from
the [Security Whitepaper](./security-whitepaper.hbs.md) and understand
[TAP's NIST compliance](./tap-nist-matrix.hbs.md).

Ingress communication uses TLS by default. Platform operators can control certificates and how they
are used by components for more information see [Ingress certificates](ingress-certificates.hbs.md).

For egress communication you can establish trust for [custom CA certificates](./custom-ca-certificates.hbs.md).
