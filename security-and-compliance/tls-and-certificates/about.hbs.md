# TLS and certificates

Ingress communication uses TLS by default. Platform operators can control
certificates and how they are used by components. See [ingress
certificates](./ingress/about.hbs.md).

For egress communication, you can establish trust for [custom CA
certificates](./custom-ca-certificates.hbs.md).
