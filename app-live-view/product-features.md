# Product features

This topic explains the Application Live View UI features.

The Application Live View encompasses a sophisticated UI that provides visual insights into running apps by inspecting the app actuator information. The actuator data from the app serves as the source of truth. Application Live View provides a live view of the data from inside of the app only. Application Live View does not store any of the app data for further analysis or historical views. This easy-to-use interface provides ways to troubleshoot, learn, and maintain an overview of certain aspects of the apps. It gives a certain level of control to the users to change some parameters such as log levels and environment properties of running apps.

The following sections describe the pages and views included in the Application Live View user interface.

## <a id="details"></a> Details page

This is the default page loaded in the **Live View** section.
This page gives a tabular overview containing the following:

- App name
- Instance ID
- Location
- Actuator location
- Health endpoint
- Direct actuator access
- Framework
- Version
- New patch version
- New major version
- Build version

You can navigate between **Information Categories** by selecting from the drop-down
at the top right corner of the page.

## <a id="environment"></a> Environment page

To navigate to the Environment page, select the **Environment** option from the
**Information Category** drop-down.

environment variables in the **Applied Overrides** section.

> **Note:** You must set the `management.endpoint.env.post.enabled=true` in the
> app config properties of the app as well as a corresponding, editable Environment
> has to be present in the app. For example in the following image it is a Spring Boot app.

The memory page highlights the memory use inside of the JVM. It displays a graphical representation of the different memory regions within heap and non-heap memory. For Spring Boot apps running on a JVM, this visualizes data from inside of the JVM, and therefore provides memory insights into the app in contrast to "outside" information about the Kubernetes pod level.

The page includes the following features:

- View real-time graphs that display a stacked overview of the different spaces in memory along with the total memory used and total memory size.
- View graphs to display the GC pauses and GC events.
- Download heap dump data using the **Heap Dump** button at the top right corner.

![Screenshot of the Memory page in the Application Live View UI.](./images/memory.png)

> **Note:** This graphical visualization happens in real-time and shows real-time data only.
> As mentioned previously, the Application Live View features do not store any information.
> That means the graphs visualize the data over time only for as long as you stay on that page.


## <a id="request-mappings"></a> Request Mappings page

> the app does not return any actuator request mappings data in the context.
> In this case, a message is displayed when the actuator toggle is enabled.
