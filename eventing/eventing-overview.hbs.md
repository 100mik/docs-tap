# Overview of Eventing

This topic gives you an overview of the Eventing package on Tanzu Application Platform (commonly known as TAP).

## Overview

Eventing in Tanzu Application Platform is a collection of APIs based on [Knative Eventing](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/) that allows the use of an event-driven architecture with your applications.

Eventing offers everything Knative Eventing does and some extras that make it ideal for cloud native
application development.
Cloud Native Runtimes gives developers a powerful default tool suite to enable event-driven
architectures with the inclusion of RabbitMQ and TriggerMesh support.

Eventing works well with these use cases:

* AI/ML
* Data replication
* Event driven and serverless application architectures
* IoT sensor data
* Parallel processing asynchronously
