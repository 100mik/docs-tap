# Installing individual packages

This document describes how to install individual Tanzu Application Platform packages
from the Tanzu Application Platform package repository.

Use the instructions on this page if you do not want to use a profile to install packages
or if you want to install additional packages after installing a profile.

Before installing the packages, ensure that you have completed the prerequisites, configured
and verified the cluster, accepted the EULA, and installed the Tanzu CLI with any required plug-ins.
For more information, see [Installing the Tanzu CLI](install-general.md).
