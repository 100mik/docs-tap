# Enable Application Bootstrapping Provenance

The Provenance transform was introduced  to provide organizations with traceability and visibility into the generation an application from an accelerator.
With the Provenance transform, several insights are embedded into a file that is part of the generated project.
These insights include the following information:
- Which accelerator was used to bootstrap the project
- Which version of the accelerator was used
- At which time the application was bootstrapped
- By whom the application was bootstrapped

For more details on the structure of the file and how to enable application bootstrapping provenance, see the [Provenance transform](creating-accelerators/transforms/provenance.md).
