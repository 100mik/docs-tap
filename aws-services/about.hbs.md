# Overview of AWS Services

AWS Services provides an integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for Tanzu Application Platform (TAP).

Through integration with [Crossplane](../crossplane/about.hbs.md) and
[Services Toolkit](../services-toolkit/about.hbs.md), these AWS services can be easily offered to
apps teams to consume, with only minimal setup and configuration required from ops teams.
This makes it incredibly quick and easy to get started working with AWS services on Tanzu Application Platform.

## <a id="getting-started"></a> Getting started

If this is your first time working with AWS Services on Tanzu Application Platform,
you might want to start by reading through [Understanding the AWS Services Package](concepts/understanding-the-aws-services-package.hbs.md), which will provide you with a better understanding of the goals of the Package, how it works as well as some of the compromises that have been made during its development. Then, you'll likely want to run through the [Quickstart](tutorials/quickstart.hbs.md) tutorial to get you up and running. Otherwise, see the [how-to guides](how-to-guides/index.hbs.md) and [reference material](reference/index.hbs.md).
