# About Bitnami Services

Bitnami Services provides an out of the box set of backing services for Tanzu Application Platform. The services consist of MySQL, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ and Redis, all of which are backed by the corresponding Bitnami Helm Chart. Through integration with [Crossplane](../crossplane/about.hbs.md) and [Services Toolkit](../services-toolkit/about.hbs.md), these four services are immediately ready to be consumed by apps teams, with no additional setup or configuration required by ops teams. This makes it incredibly quick and easy to get started working with services on Tanzu Application Platform.

## Where to start

If this is your first time working with Bitnami Services on Tanzu Application Platform, then it is recommended to run through the tutorial [Working with Bitnami Services](../services-toolkit/tutorials/working-with-bitnami-services.hbs.md). Otherwise please feel free to refer to the [how-to guides](how-to-guides/index.hbs.md) and [reference material](reference/index.hbs.md) to learn more.
