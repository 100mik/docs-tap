# How to add an external plug-in

The Tanzu Developer Portal Configurator tool enables you to add functions (plug-ins) to Tanzu Developer Portal, turning it into a customized portal.

There are several scenarios that the Configurator tool can help you to integrate a compatible plug-in:
- [How to add an external plug-in](#how-to-add-an-external-plug-in)
  - [ Add a validated community Backstage plug-in](#-add-a-validated-community-backstage-plug-in)
  - [ Add a non-validated community or custom Backstage plug-in](#-add-a-non-validated-community-or-custom-backstage-plug-in)

As of this release, the Configurator tool can integrate a pre-existing plug-in, but it does not have the capability to create a new Backstage plug-in. 

VMware Tanzu as an organization can certainly assist you with creating your own plug-in or with modifying an existing plug-in to your specification. For more information, please visit [link](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs).

For more information on how to create a Backstage plug-in, please refer to the [Backstage's Documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/create-a-plugin).
