# Set up developer namespaces to use your installed packages

This topic tells you how to set up developer namespaces to use your installed packages.

You must first enable your namespace for Tanzu Application Platform Supply Chains 
and then optionally apply Kubernetes RBAC for additional non-admin user access. 
For more information, see:

1. [Enable namespace for Supply Chains](#enable-namespace).
1. (Optional) [Enable non-admin users access with Kubernetes RBAC](#additional-user-access).

## <a id='enable-namespace'></a>Enable namespace for Supply Chains

The `default` ServiceAaccount in your developer namespace requires permission to your image repositories and RoleBindings for Tanzu Application Platform `ClusterRoles`.  The [Namespace Provisioner](../namespace-provisioner/about.hbs.md) watches namespaces for a specific label, then takes action to enable the namespace. 

To enable the Supply Chain on your namespace, run:

```console
kubectl label namespace $YOUR-NAMESPACE apps.tanzu.vmware.com/tap-ns=""
```

Where `YOUR-NAMESPACE` is your developer namespace.

## <a id='additional-user-access'></a>(Optional) Enable non-admin users access with Kubernetes RBAC

Follow these steps to enable non-admin users by using Kubernetes RBAC to submit jobs to the Supply Chain:

1. Choose either of the following options to give developers namespace-level access and view access to appropriate cluster-level resources:

    - **Option 1:** Use the [Tanzu Application Platform RBAC CLI plug-in (beta)](../authn-authz/binding.hbs.md#install).

        To use the `tanzu rbac` plug-in to grant `app-viewer` and `app-editor` roles to an identity provider group, run:

        ```console
        tanzu rbac binding add -g GROUP-FOR-APP-VIEWER -n YOUR-NAMESPACE -r app-viewer
        tanzu rbac binding add -g GROUP-FOR-APP-EDITOR -n YOUR-NAMESPACE -r app-editor
        ```

        Where:

        - `YOUR-NAMESPACE` is the name you give to the developer namespace.
        - `GROUP-FOR-APP-VIEWER` is the user group from the upstream identity provider that requires access to `app-viewer` resources on the current namespace and cluster.
        - `GROUP-FOR-APP-EDITOR` is the user group from the upstream identity provider that requires access to `app-editor` resources on the current namespace and cluster.

        For more information about `tanzu rbac`, see
        [Bind a user or group to a default role](../authn-authz/binding.html).

        VMware recommends creating a user group in your identity provider's grouping system for each
        developer namespace and then adding the users accordingly.

        Depending on your identity provider, you might need to take further action to
        federate user groups appropriately with your cluster.
        For an example of how to set up Azure Active Directory (AD) with your cluster, see
        [Integrating Azure Active Directory](../authn-authz/azure-ad.html).

    - **Option 2:** Use the native Kubernetes YAML.

        To apply the RBAC policy, run:

        ```console
        cat <<EOF | kubectl -n YOUR-NAMESPACE apply -f -
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: RoleBinding
        metadata:
          name: dev-permit-app-viewer
        roleRef:
          apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
          kind: ClusterRole
          name: app-viewer
        subjects:
          - kind: Group
            name: GROUP-FOR-APP-VIEWER
            apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        ---
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: ClusterRoleBinding
        metadata:
          name: YOUR-NAMESPACE-permit-app-viewer
        roleRef:
          apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
          kind: ClusterRole
          name: app-viewer-cluster-access
        subjects:
          - kind: Group
            name: GROUP-FOR-APP-VIEWER
            apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        ---
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: RoleBinding
        metadata:
          name: dev-permit-app-editor
        roleRef:
          apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
          kind: ClusterRole
          name: app-editor
        subjects:
          - kind: Group
            name: GROUP-FOR-APP-EDITOR
            apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        ---
        apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
        kind: ClusterRoleBinding
        metadata:
          name: YOUR-NAMESPACE-permit-app-editor
        roleRef:
          apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
          kind: ClusterRole
          name: app-editor-cluster-access
        subjects:
          - kind: Group
            name: GROUP-FOR-APP-EDITOR
            apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        EOF
        ```

        Where:

        - `YOUR-NAMESPACE` is the name you give to the developer namespace.
        - `GROUP-FOR-APP-VIEWER` is the user group from the upstream identity provider that requires access to `app-viewer` resources on the current namespace and cluster.
        - `GROUP-FOR-APP-EDITOR` is the user group from the upstream identity provider that requires access to `app-editor` resources on the current namespace and cluster.

        VMware recommends creating a user group in your identity provider's grouping system for each
        developer namespace and then adding the users accordingly.

        Depending on your identity provider, you might need to take further action to
        federate user groups appropriately with your cluster.
        For an example of how to set up Azure Active Directory (AD) with your cluster, see
        [Integrating Azure Active Directory](../authn-authz/azure-ad.html).

        Rather than granting roles directly to individuals, VMware recommends using your identity provider's user groups system to grant access to a group of developers.
        For an example of how to set up Azure AD with your cluster, see
        [Integrating Azure Active Directory](../authn-authz/azure-ad.html).
