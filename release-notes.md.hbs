<<<<<<< HEAD
- Breaking change 1
- Breaking change 2
=======
- You must configure integration with Supply Chain Security Tools - Store for the Grype Scanner and Snyk Scanner packages to enable this feature. The configuration for Supply Chain Security Tools - Store in Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan is only for the deprecated Grype Scanner `ScanTemplate`s.
- For the profile configuration of Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan, the scanning component no longer takes the metadata store configurations as of v1.2.0.
  - For information about configuring metadata store by using the Grype component instead of the scanning component as of v1.2.0, see [Install multicluster Tanzu Application Platform profiles
](multicluster/installing-multicluster.md).
  - See [Build profile](multicluster/reference/tap-values-build-sample.md) for the deprecated way of writing the metadata store configuration through the scanning component.

  >**Note:** This doesn't apply if you are using the deprecated Grype Scanner `ScanTemplate`s prior to Grype Scanner `v1.2.0`.

  - The package name changed from `package policies` to `package main`.
  - The deny rule changed from the boolean `isCompliant` to the array of strings `deny[msg]`.
  - The sample `ScanPolicy` is different if you're using Grype Scanner with a CycloneDX structure or Snyk Scanner with a SPDX JSON structure. See [Install Snyk Scanner](scst-scan/install-snyk-integration.md) for an example of a Scan Policy.
  - See [Enforce compliance policy using Open Policy Agent](scst-scan/policies.md) for an example of the current ScanPolicy format for v1.2.0 and later.
