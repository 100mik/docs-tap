# Use Gitops Delivery with FluxCD (alpha)

This topic explains how to deliver Carvel `Packages`, created by the Carvel Package Supply Chains, from a GitOps repository to one or more run clusters using FluxCD.

## Prerequisites

To use Gitops Delivery with FluxCD, you must complete the following prerequisites:

- You must create a `Workload` that uses either the `source-to-url-package` or `basic-image-to-url-package` Carvel Package Supply Chain. See the [documentation](./carvel-package-supply-chain.hbs.md). You must have at least one Carvel `Package` generated by this `Workload` stored in your GitOps repository.
- You must have at least one Run cluster. Run clusters serve as your deployment environments. They can either be Tanzu Application Platform clusters, or regular Kubernetes clusters, but they must have kapp-controller and Contour installed. See the [Carvel documentation](https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller/) and the [Contour documentation](https://projectcontour.io/).
- You must create a Build cluster that has network access to your Run clusters. It must have FluxCD Kustomize Controller installed. See the [Flux documentation](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#dev-install).

## Set up Run Cluster Namespaces

Each Run cluster must have a namespace and `ServiceAccount` with the correct permissions to deploy the Carvel `Packages`.

If your Run cluster is also a Tanzu Application Platform cluster, see the [documentation](../set-up-namespaces.hbs.md) to set up a developer namespace.

If your Run cluster is not a Tanzu Application Platform cluster, create a namespace and `ServiceAccount` with the following permissions:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: <run-cluster-ns>
  name: app-cr-role
rules:
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "delete"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["configmaps", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "delete"]
- apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["ingresses"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "create", "update", "delete"]
```

## Create Carvel PackageInstalls and Secrets

For each Carvel `Package`, for each Run cluster, you must create a Carvel `PackageInstall` and a `Secret`. The Carvel `PackageInstall` and the `Secret` will be stored in your GitOps repository and deployed to Run clusters by FluxCD.

Here is an example GitOps repository structure after completing this section:

```console
app.default.tap/
  packages/
    20230321004057.0.0.yaml  # Package
  staging/
    packageinstall.yaml      # PackageInstall
    params.yaml              # Secret
  prod/
    packageinstall.yaml      # PackageInstall
    params.yaml              # Secret
```

1. For each Run cluster, create a `Secret` that has the values for each `Package` parameter. You can see the configurable properties of the `Package` by inspecting the `Package` CRâ€™s valuesSchema, or in the Carvel Package Supply Chains [documentation](./carvel-package-supply-chain.hbs.md). Store the `Secret` in your GitOps repository at `<package_name>/<run_cluster>/params.yaml`.

   ```yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: app-values
   stringData:
     values.yaml: |
       ---
       replicas: 2
       hostname: app.mycompany.com
   ```

   > **Note:** You can skip this step if you want to use the default parameter values.

2. For each Run cluster, create a `PackageInstall`. Reference the `Secret` you created in the previous step. Store the `PackageInstall` in your GitOps repository at `<package_name>/<run_cluster>/packageinstall.yaml`.

   ```yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: packaging.carvel.dev/v1alpha1
   kind: PackageInstall
   metadata:
     name: app
   spec:
     serviceAccountName: <run-cluster-ns-sa> # ServiceAccount on Run cluster with permissions to deploy Package, see "Set up Run Cluster Namespaces"
     packageRef:
       refName: app.default.tap # name of the Package
       versionSelection:
         constraints: 20230321004057.0.0 # version of the Package
     values:
     - secretRef:
         name: app-values # Secret created in previous step
   ```

   > **Note:** If you want to continously deploy the latest version of your `Package`, you can set `versionSelection.constraints: >=0.0.0`
   > **Note:** If you skipped creation of the `Secret`, omit the `values` key.

3. Push the newly created `PackageInstalls` and `Secrets` to your GitOps repository.

## Create FluxCD GitRepository + FluxCD Kustomizations on the Build Cluster

Now we need to configure FluxCD on the Build cluster to deploy our `Packages`, `PackageInstalls`, and `Secrets` to each of our run clusters.

1. We need to give our Build cluster access to our Run clusters. On the Build cluster, for each Run cluster, create a `Secret` containing the Run cluster's kubeconfig:

   ```console
   kubectl create secret generic <run-cluster>-kubeconfig \
       -n <build-cluster-ns> \
       --from-file=value.yaml=<path-to-run-cluster-kubeconfig>
   ```

2. We need to configure our Build cluster to clone the GitOps repository. On the Build cluster, create the following FluxCD `GitRepository`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
   kind: GitRepository
   metadata:
     name: <package-name>-gitops-repo
     namespace: <build-cluster-ns>
   spec:
     url: # GitOps repo URL
     gitImplementation: go-git
     ignore: |
       !.git
     interval: 30s
     ref:
       branch: # GitOps repo branch
     timeout: 60s
 
     # only required if GitOps repo is private (recommended)
     secretRef:
       name: <package-name>-gitops-auth
       namespace: <build-cluster-ns>

   # only required if GitOps repo is private (recommended)
   ---
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: <package-name>-gitops-auth
     namespace: <build-cluster-ns>
   type: Opaque
   data:
     username: # base64 encoded GitHub (or other git remote) username
     password: # base64 encoded GitHub (or other git remote) personal access token
   ```

3. We need to configure our Build cluster to deploy our `Package` to the Run clusters. For each Run cluster, on the Build cluster, create the following FluxCD `Kustomization`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
   kind: Kustomization
   metadata:
     name: <package-name>-<run-cluster>-packages
     namespace: <build-cluster-ns>
   spec:
     sourceRef:
       kind: GitRepository
       name: <package-name>-gitops-repo
       namespace: <build-cluster-ns>
     path: "./<package-name>/packages"
     interval: 5m
     timeout: 5m
     prune: true
     wait: true

     # where to deploy
     kubeConfig:
       secretRef:
         name: <run-cluster>-kubeconfig
         namespace: <build-cluster-ns>
     targetNamespace: <run-cluster-ns>
     serviceAccountName: <run-cluster-ns-sa>
   ```

4. We need to configure our Build cluster to deploy our `PackageInstalls` and `Secrets` to the Run clusters. For each Run cluster, on the Build cluster, create the following FluxCD `Kustomization`:

   ```yaml
   ---
   apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
   kind: Kustomization
   metadata:
     # for the second run cluster, for example hello-app-prod2-packages
     name: <package-name>-<run-cluster>-packageinstalls
     namespace: <build-cluster-ns>
   spec:
     sourceRef:
       kind: GitRepository
       name: <package-name>-gitops-repo
       namespace: <build-cluster-ns>
     path: "./<package-name>/<run-cluster>"
     interval: 5m
     timeout: 5m
     prune: true
     wait: true
   
     # where to deploy
     kubeConfig:
       secretRef:
         name: <run-cluster>-kubeconfig
         namespace: <build-cluster-ns>
     targetNamespace: <run-cluster-ns>
     serviceAccountName: <run-cluster-ns-sa>
   ```

## Verifying Installation

To verify your installation:

1. On your Build cluster, confirm that your FluxCD GitRepository and Kustomizations are reconciling:

   ```console
   kubectl get gitrepositories,kustomizations -A
   ```

2. Target a Run cluster. Confirm that all Packages from the GitOps repository are deployed:

   ```console
   kubectl get packages -A
   ```

3. Target a Run cluster. Confirm that all PackageInstalls are reconciled:

   ```console
   kubectl get packageinstalls -A
   ```

Now you can access your application on each Run cluster.
