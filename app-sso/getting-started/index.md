# Getting started

ðŸ‘‰ This article assumes AppSSO is installed on your TAP cluster. To install AppSSO, refer to the instructions
in [Install AppSSO](../platform-operators/installation.md).

---

In this section, you will:

1. Get an [overview of AppSSO](appsso-overview.md)
2. [Set up your first authorization server](provision-auth-server.md), and validate that it is running
3. [Provision a ClientRegistration](client-registration.md), and validate it is working
4. [Deploy an application](application.md) that uses the provisioned ClientRegistration to enable SSO

---

âœ… Once you have completed the above steps, you can continue
by [securing a Workload](../app-operators/tutorials/securing-first-workload.md).
