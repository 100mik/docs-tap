# Convention Service

>**Caution:** This component is being deprecated in favor of [Cartographer Conventions](../cartographer-conventions/about.md).

The new [Cartographer Conventions](../cartographer-conventions/about.md) has to be installed if you wish to add conventions to your pod.
The 0.7.0 version of the convention controller is a passive system that just translates the CRDs to the [new group](../cartographer-conventions/reference/pod-intent.md).
