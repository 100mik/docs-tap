# Release notes

This topic contains release notes for Supply Chain Security Tools â€“ Scan.

## Releases

### v1.0.0

**Release Date:** December 10, 2021

### New in this Release
* Enhanced scanning coverage is now available for Node.js apps.
* CA certificates are now automatically imported from the Metadata Store namespace
### Known Issues
* Blob Source Scans have an edge case where when a compressed file without a `.git` directory is provided, sending results to the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store will fail and the scanned revision value will not be set.
    * The current workaround is to add the `.git` directory to the compressed file.
    * This issue will be fixed post GA.
* Events show `SaveScanResultsSuccess` when the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store is not configured.
    * The `.status.conditions` output does correctly reflect `SendingResults=False`.
    * This issue will be fixed post GA.
