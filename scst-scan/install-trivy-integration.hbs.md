# Prerequisites for Trivy Scanner (Alpha)

This topic describes prerequisites for installing SCST - Scan (Trivy) from the VMware package repository.

>**Important** This integration is in Alpha, which means that it is still in active
>development by the Tanzu Practice Global Tech Team and might be subject to
>change at any point. Users might encounter unexpected behavior.

## Verify the latest alpha package version

Run the following command to output a list of available tags.

```shell
imgpkg tag list -i projects.registry.vmware.com/tanzu_practice/tap-scanners-package/trivy-repo-scanning-bundle | grep -v sha | sort -V
```

For example:

``` shell
imgpkg tag list -i projects.registry.vmware.com/tanzu_practice/tap-scanners-package/trivy-repo-scanning-bundle | grep -v sha | sort -V

0.1.4-alpha.6
0.1.4-alpha.1
0.1.4-alpha.3
0.1.4-alpha.5
0.1.4-alpha.6
```

In this topic, use the latest version returned by the command above.

## Relocate images to a registry

VMware recommends relocating the images from VMware Tanzu Network registry to
your own container image registry before installing.

The Trivy Scanner is in the Alpha development phase, is not packaged as part of
the Tanzu Application Platform package, and is hosted on the VMware Project
Repository instead of VMware Tanzu Network. If you relocated the Tanzu
Application Platform images, you might also want to relocate the Trivy Scanner
package.

If you donâ€™t relocate the images, the Trivy Scanner installation depends on
VMware Tanzu Network for continued operation, and VMware Tanzu Network offers no
uptime guarantees. The option to skip relocation is documented for evaluation
and proof-of-concept only.

For information about supported registries, see the registry's documentation.

To relocate images from the VMware Project Registry to your registry:

1. Install Docker if it is not already installed.

1. Set up environment variables for installation by running:

    ```console
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_USERNAME=MY-REGISTRY-USER
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=MY-REGISTRY-PASSWORD
    export INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME=MY-REGISTRY
    export VERSION=VERSION-NUMBER
    export INSTALL_REPO=TARGET-REPOSITORY
    ```

    Where:

    - `MY-REGISTRY-USER` is the user with write access to MY-REGISTRY.
    - `MY-REGISTRY-PASSWORD` is the password for `MY-REGISTRY-USER`.
    - `MY-REGISTRY` is your own registry.
    - `VERSION` is your Trivy Scanner version. For example, `0.1.4-alpha.6`.
    - `TARGET-REPOSITORY` is your target repository, a directory or repository on `MY-REGISTRY` that serves as the location for the installation files for Trivy Scanner.

2. Install the Carvel tool imgpkg CLI. See [Deploying Cluster Essentials v1.4](https://docs.vmware.com/en/Cluster-Essentials-for-VMware-Tanzu/1.4/cluster-essentials/deploy.html#optionally-install-clis-onto-your-path-6).

3. Relocate the images with the imgpkg CLI by running:

    ```shell
    imgpkg copy -b projects.registry.vmware.com/tanzu_practice/tap-scanners-package/trivy-repo-scanning-bundle:${VERSION} --to-repo ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/${INSTALL_REPO}/trivy-repo-scanning-bundle
    ```

> **Note**
> The VMware project repository does not require authentication, so you don't need to perform a Docker login.

## Add the Trivy Scanner package repository

Tanzu CLI packages are available on repositories. Adding the Trivy Scanning
package repository makes the Trivy Scanning bundle and its packages available
for installation.

> **Note**
> VMware recommends, but does not require, relocating images to a registry for installation. The following section requires that you relocated images to a registry. See the earlier section to fill in the variables.

VMware recommends installing the Trivy Scanner objects in the existing `tap-install` namespace to keep the Trivy Scanner grouped logically with the other Tanzu Application Platform components.

1. Add the Trivy Scanner package repository to the cluster by running:

    ```shell
    tanzu package repository add trivy-scanner-repository \
      --url ${INSTALL_REGISTRY_HOSTNAME}/${INSTALL_REPO}/trivy-repo-scanning-bundle:$VERSION \
      --namespace tap-install
    ```

2. Get the status of the Trivy Scanner package repository, and ensure that the status updates to `Reconcile succeeded` by running:

    ```shell
    tanzu package repository get trivy-scanner-repository --namespace tap-install
    ```

    For example:

    ```console
   tanzu package repository get trivy-scanner-repository --namespace tap-install

   NAME:          trivy-scanner-repository
   VERSION:       7750726
   REPOSITORY:    projects.registry.vmware.com/tanzu_practice/tap-scanners-package/trivy-repo-scanning-bundle
   TAG:           0.1.4-alpha.6
   STATUS:        Reconcile succeeded
   REASON:
    ```

3. List the available packages by running:

    ```shell
    tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    ```

    For example:

    ```console
    $ tanzu package available list --namespace tap-install
    / Retrieving available packages...
      NAME                                                 DISPLAY-NAME                       SHORT-DESCRIPTION
      trivy.scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com                   trivy                              Default scan templates using Trivy
    ```

## Prepare the Trivy Scanner configuration

Before installing the Trivy Scanner, you must create the configuration necessary to install

Define the `--values-file` flag to customize the default configuration. You must define the following fields in the `values.yaml` file for the Trivy
Scanner configuration. You can add fields as needed to activate or deactivate behaviors. You can append the values to the `values.yaml` file. Create a `values.yaml` file by using the following configuration:

```yaml
    ---
    namespace: DEV-NAMESPACE
    targetImagePullSecret: TARGET-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET
    targetSourceSshSecret: TARGET-SOURCE-SSH-SECRET
```

   Where:

   - `DEV-NAMESPACE` is your developer namespace.
   > **Note** To use a namespace other than the default namespace, ensure that
   the namespace exists before you install. If the namespace does not exist,
   the scanner installation fails.
   - `TARGET-REGISTRY-CREDENTIALS-SECRET` is the name of the secret that contains the
     credentials to pull an image from a private registry for scanning.
   - `TARGET-SOURCE-SSH-SECRET` is the name of the secret containing SSH credentials for cloning private repositories

To see all available values, run the following command using the version that you want:

```shell
VERSION="0.1.4-alpha.6"
tanzu package available get trivy.scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/$VERSION --values-schema -n tap-install
```

Example output:

```console
  KEY                                           DEFAULT                                                           TYPE    DESCRIPTION

```

## SCST - Store integration

The Trivy integration can work with or without the SCST - Store integration. The `values.yaml` file is slightly different for each configuration.

To persist the results found by the Trivy Scanner, enable the SCST -
Store integration by appending the SCST- scan fields to the Trivy `values.yaml` file.

The Grype, Snyk, Prisma, Carbon Black, and Trivy Scanner Integrations enable the Metadata Store. To
prevent conflicts, the configuration values are slightly different based on
whether another scanner integration is installed or not. If Tanzu Application
Platform is installed using the Full Profile, the Grype Scanner Integration is
installed unless it is explicitly excluded.

### Multiple Scanners installed

When installing Trivy Scanner, find your CA secret name and authentication token secret
name for your `values.yaml` ny looking at the configuration of a prior installed
scanner in the same namespace as it already exists.

For information about how the scanner was initially created, see [Multicluster Setup](../scst-store/multicluster-setup.hbs.md).

The following example `values.yaml` has other scanners already installed in the same `dev-namespace` where the Trivy Scanner is installed:

```yaml
#! ...
metadataStore:
  #! The url where the Store deployment is accessible.
  #! Default value is: "https://metadata-store-app.metadata-store.svc.cluster.local:8443"
  url: "STORE-URL"
  caSecret:
    #! The name of the secret that contains the ca.crt to connect to the Store Deployment.
    #! Default value is: "app-tls-cert"
    name: "CA-SECRET-NAME"
    importFromNamespace: "" #! since both Trivy and Grype/Snyk both enable store, one must leave importFromNamespace blank
  #! authSecret is for multicluster configurations.
  authSecret:
    #! The name of the secret that contains the auth token to authenticate to the Store Deployment.
    name: "AUTH-SECRET-NAME"
    importFromNamespace: "" #! since both Trivy and Grype/Snyk both enable store, one must leave importFromNamespace blank
```

Where:

- `STORE-URL` is the URL where the Store deployment is accessible.
- `CA-SECRET-NAME` is the name of the secret that contains the ca.crt to connect
  to the Store Deployment. Default is `app-tls-cert`.
- `AUTH-SECRET-NAME` is the name of the secret that contains the authentication token to
  authenticate to the Store Deployment.

### Trivy Only Scanner Installed

For a walk through of creating and exporting secrets for the Metadata Store CA and authentication token which referenced in the data values, see [Multicluster Setup](../scst-store/multicluster-setup.hbs.md).

The following example `values.yaml` has no other scanner integrations installed in the same `dev-namespace` where the Trivy Scanner is installed:

```yaml
#! ...
metadataStore:
  #! The url where the Store deployment is accessible.
  #! Default value is: "https://metadata-store-app.metadata-store.svc.cluster.local:8443"
  url: "STORE-URL"
  caSecret:
    #! The name of the secret that contains the ca.crt to connect to the Store Deployment.
    #! Default value is: "app-tls-cert"
    name: "CA-SECRET-NAME"
    #! The namespace where the secrets for the Store Deployment live.
    #! Default value is: "metadata-store"
    importFromNamespace: "STORE-SECRETS-NAMESPACE"
  #! authSecret is for multicluster configurations.
  authSecret:
    #! The name of the secret that contains the auth token to authenticate to the Store Deployment.
    name: "AUTH-SECRET-NAME"
    #! The namespace where the secrets for the Store Deployment live.
    importFromNamespace: "STORE-SECRETS-NAMESPACE"
```

Where:

- `STORE-URL` is the URL where the Store deployment is accessible.
- `CA-SECRET-NAME` is the name of the secret that contains the `ca.crt` to connect to the Store Deployment. Default is `app-tls-cert`.
- `STORE-SECRETS-NAMESPACE` is the namespace where the secrets for the Store Deployment live. Default is `metadata-store`.
- `AUTH-SECRET-NAME` is the name of the secret that contains the authentication token to authenticate to the Store Deployment.

### No Store Integration

If you do not want to enable the SCST - Store integration, deactivate the integration by appending the following fields to the `values.yaml` file that is enabled by default:

```yaml
# ...
metadataStore:
  url: "" # Configuration is moved, so set this string to empty
```

## Prepare the ScanPolicy

The following sample ScanPolicy allows you to control whether the SupplyChain passes or fails based on the CycloneDX vulnerability results returned from the Trivy Scanner.

```yaml
---
apiVersion: scanning.apps.tanzu.vmware.com/v1beta1
kind: ScanPolicy
metadata:
   name: trivy-scan-policy
   labels:
      app.kubernetes.io/part-of: enable-in-gui
spec:
   regoFile: |
      package main

      import future.keywords.in
      import future.keywords.every

      # Accepted Values: "critical", "high", "medium", "low", unknown"
      notAllowedSeverities := ["critical", "high", "unknown"]
      notAllowedSet := {x | x := notAllowedSeverities[_]}
      ignoreCves := []

      isSafe(match) {
        severities := { e | e := match.ratings.rating.severity } | { e | e := match.ratings.rating[_].severity }
        every severity in severities {
            not severity in notAllowedSet
        }
      }

      isIgnored(match) {
        match.id in ignoreCves
      }

      deny[msg] {
        notAllowedVulnerabilities := { vulnerability |
          vulnerabilities := {e | e := input.bom.vulnerabilities.vulnerability} | {e | e := input.bom.vulnerabilities.vulnerability[_]}
          some vulnerability in vulnerabilities
          not isIgnored(vulnerability)
          not isSafe(vulnerability)
        }
        formattedVulnerabilityMessages := { message |
          some vulnerability in notAllowedVulnerabilities
          ratings := {e | e := vulnerability.ratings.rating.severity} | {e | e := vulnerability.ratings.rating[_].severity}
          formattedRatings := concat(", ", ratings)
          affectedComponents := {e | e := vulnerability.affects.target.ref} | {e | e := vulnerability.affects.target[_].ref}
          formattedComponents := concat("\\\n", affectedComponents)
          message = sprintf("CVE: %s \\\nRatings: %s\\\nAffected Components: \\\n%s", [vulnerability.id, formattedRatings, formattedComponents])
        }
        some formattedVulnerabilityMessage in formattedVulnerabilityMessages
        msg := formattedVulnerabilityMessage
      }
```

Apply the following to the YAML:

```console
kubectl apply -n $DEV-NAMESPACE -f SCAN-POLICY-YAML
```

Where:

- `DEV-NAMESPACE` is the name of the developer namespace you want to use.
- `SCAN-POLICY-YAML` is the name of your SCST - Scan YAML.

## Install Trivy Scanner

After all prerequisites are completed, install the Trivy Scanner. See [Install another scanner for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](install-scanners.hbs.md).

## Air-Gap Configuration

The following section explains how to configure Trivy in an air gap environment.

For information about additional flags and configuration, see [Air-Gapped Environment](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/advanced/air-gap/) in the Trivy documentation.

### Prerequisites

Install the `oras` cli. See [Installation](https://oras.land/cli/) in the ORAS documentation.

### Relocate Trivy database to your registry

>**Note** Using a relocated database means you are taking responsibility for keeping it up to date to ensure that security scans are relevant. Stale databases weaken your security posture.

If you have a host with access, you can use the `oras` cli to perform a copy.

```shell
oras copy -r ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db:2 registry.company.com/project_name/trivy-db:2 # the tag of 2 is required

Copying 4a39b38cf2fd db.tar.gz
Copied  4a39b38cf2fd db.tar.gz
Copied ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db:2 => registry.company.com/project_name/trivy-db:2
Digest: sha256:ed57874a80499e858caac27fc92e4952346eb75a2774809ee989bcd2ce48897a
```

If not, you can use the `oras` cli to download the database and manifest and then push to your registry.

1. Download the trivy-db.

   ```shell
   oras pull ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db:2
   ```

   Example output:

   ```console
   oras pull ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db:2
   Downloading 1612cc15d377 db.tar.gz
   Downloaded  1612cc15d377 db.tar.gz
   Pulled ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db:2
   Digest: sha256:af903c7ddbe7516f18b06254b6297cf53c0ece918def07322925c71d2f694860
   ```

2. Download the manifest for trivy-db.

   ```shell
   oras manifest fetch ghcr.io/aquasecurity/trivy-db:2 > trivy-db-manifest.json
   ```

3. Add the media type to the manifest.

   ```shell
   jq '.mediaType="application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json"' trivy-db-manifest.json > updated-trivy-db-manifest.json
   ```

4. Push the prior downloaded trivy-db to your registry.

   ```shell
   oras push registry.company.com/project_name/trivy-db:2 ./db.tar.gz
   ```

   Example output:

   ```console
   oras push registry.company.com/project_name/trivy-db:2 \
     ./db.tar.gz

   Uploading 1612cc15d377 db.tar.gz
   Uploaded  1612cc15d377 db.tar.gz
   Pushed registry.company.com/project_name/trivy-db:2
   Digest: sha256:41a7eeab8837e90d8a5afd56cfce73936e15d3db04c5294f992ecff9492971dc
   ```

5. Push the updated trivy-db manifest to your registry

   ```shell
   oras manifest push registry.company.com/project_name/trivy-db:2 updated-trivy-db-manifest.json
   ```

   Example output:

   ```console
   oras manifest push registry.company.com/project_name/trivy-db:2 updated-trivy-db-manifest.json
   Pushed registry.company.com/project_name/trivy-db:2
   Digest: sha256:b51a2fccf38e723aac1a7217ba36ca52398b2b20e3d74c9d5089dfdcd9bb2f11
   ```

6. Cleanup files

   ```shell
   rm trivy-db-manifest.json updated-trivy-db-manifest.json db.tar.gz
   ````

### Update data values with db repository URL

Edit your `values.yaml` to add the following:

```yaml
trivy:
  db:
    repositoryUrl: "registry.company.com/project_name/trivy-db"
```

The URL leaves off the tag of `2`.

## Use another Trivy Version

This section describes how to use a different Trivy CLI version than what is bundled with the package.

### Prerequisites

```

## Use another Trivy Aqua Plug-in Version

The Trivy Aqua Plug-in enables Aqua SaaS integration with your Trivy scans.

### Prerequisites

Install the `oras` cli. See [Installation](https://oras.land/cli/) in the Oras documentation.

### Download the Plug-in

Download the version of the Trivy Aqua Plug-in you want from the GitHub releases page. See [trivy-plugin-aqua](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-plugin-aqua/releases) in GitHub.
For example, [v0.115.14](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-plugin-aqua/releases/download/v0.115.5/linux_amd64_v0.115.5.tar.gz) in GitHub.

```console
TRIVY-AQUA-PLUGIN-VERSION="v0.115.6"
wget -c "https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-plugin-aqua/releases/download/${TRIVY-AQUA-PLUGIN-VERSION}/linux_amd64_${TRIVY-AQUA-PLUGIN-VERSION}.tar.gz" -O trivy-aqua-plugin.tar.gz

```

Where:

- `TRIVY-AQUA-PLUGIN-VERSION` is the version of Trivy Aqua Plug-in you are using.
- `REPOSITORY-URL` is the repository where you want to relocate the plug in.

### Update data values with Aqua Plug-in repository URL

Edit your `values.yaml` to add the location of your CLI.

```yaml
trivy:
  plugins:
    aqua:
      repositoryUrl: "registry.company.com/project_name/trivy-aqua-plugin:v0.115.6"
```

## Integrate with Aqua SaaS Platform

The following sections explain how to integrate with Aqua SaaS platform.

### Create API Key

In order to connect to the SaaS Platform you must have an API key. To create an API key:

1. Log into Aqua SaaS.
2. Enter CSPM.
3. Click **Settings** -> **API Keys**.
4. Click **Generate Key**.
5. Save the information for the next steps.

### Create Auth Secret

In order to integrate with Aqua SaaS Platform you must have an API key. You pass this to the scanner through environment variables, referenced in a secret.

Example secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: aqua-creds
  namespace: APP-NAMESPACE
stringData:
  aqua-key: API-KEY
  aqua-secret: API-KEY-SECRET
```

Where:

- `APP-NAMESPACE` is the developer namespace your app uses.
- `API-KEY` is the Aqua Platform API Key.
- `API-KEY-SECRET` is the Aqua Platform API Keyâ€™s Secret.

### Update aqua-values.yaml

In order to tell Trivy to connect and report to Aqua SaaS it requires a few environment variables set.

You can find plug in options in the [README.md](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-plugin-aqua/blob/master/README.md) in GitHub.

Here is an example of referencing your API key and secret from a prior created Kubernetes Secret:

```yaml
namespace: dev
targetImagePullSecret: registry-credentials
environmentVariables:
  - name: TRIVY-RUN-AS-PLUGIN
    value: aqua
  - name: AQUA-KEY
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: aqua-creds
        key: aqua-key
  - name: AQUA-SECRET
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef:
        name: aqua-creds
        key: aqua-secret
```

Where:

- `TRIVY-RUN-AS-PLUGIN` is the Trivy Plugin you want to enable without using the subcommand.
- `AQUA-KEY` is the Aqua Platform API Key.
- `AQUA-SECRET` is the Aqua Platform API Keyâ€™s Secret.

## Self-Signed Registry Certificate

You need additional configuration when attempting to pull an image from a registry with a self-signed certificate during image scans.

### Tanzu Application Platform Values Shared CA

If your `tap-values.yaml` used during install has the following shared section filled out, Trivy Scanner uses this and enable it to connect to your registry without additional configuration.

```yaml
shared:
   ca_cert_data: | # To be passed if using custom certificates.
      -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
      MIIFXzCCA0egAwIBAgIJAJYm37SFocjlMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBDQUAMEY...
      -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### Secret within Developer Namespace

1. Create a secret that holds the registry's CA certificate data.

   An example of the secret:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: trivy-registry-cert
     namespace: dev
   type: Opaque
   data:
     ca_cert_data: BASE64_CERT
   ```

2. Update your Trivy Scanner install values.yaml.

   Add `caCertSecret` to the root of your `trivy-values.yaml` when installing Trivy Scanner

   Example:
   
   ```yaml
   namespace: dev
   targetImagePullSecret: tap-registry
   caCertSecret: trivy-registry-cert
   ```
