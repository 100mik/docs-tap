# Overview of Tanzu Portal Builder

<!-- This section has been created for the new component - Tanzu Portal Builder. It is expected to be refined and updated before the TAP 1.6.0 release -->

Tanzu Portal Builder is a tool for your operators to create and configure your developer portal. This developer portal would provide a central location in which you can view dependencies, relationships, technical documentation, runtime resources, and integrations to your tools of choice.
