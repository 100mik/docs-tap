# Overview of Tanzu Portal Builder

Tanzu Portal Builder is a tool for your operators to create and configure your developer portal.
This developer portal provides a central location in which you can view dependencies,
relationships, technical documentation, runtime resources, and integrations with your tools of choice.

Tanzu Portal Builder uses the
[Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) project [Backstage](https://backstage.io/).

For more information about what a Backstage-based developer portal can do, see the
[Tanzu Application Platform GUI documentation](../tap-gui/about.hbs.md).
