_Tanzu Developer Tools for Visual Studio_ is VMware Tanzu's official IDE extension for Visual Studio to help you develop with the Tanzu Application Platform (TAP).

This plugin extends Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 only; it is incompatible with both Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio for Mac.

> _**Note:** This extension is currently under development_

## Extension Features

**See code updates running on-cluster in seconds**

With the use of Live Update facilitated by Tilt, deploy your workload once, save changes to the code and then, seconds later, see those changes reflected in the workload running on the cluster. All Live Update output is filtered to it's own output pane window withing Visual Studio.

**Debug workloads directly on the cluster**

Debug your application in a production-like environment by debugging on your Kubernetes cluster that has Tanzu Application Platform. An environmentâ€™s similarity to production relies on keeping dependencies updated, among other variables.
