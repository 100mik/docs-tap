# Tanzu Build Service

This topic provides you with an overview of VMware Tanzu Build Service.

## Overview

Tanzu Build Service automates container creation, management, and governance at enterprise scale.
Tanzu Build Service uses the open-source [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/)
project to turn application source code into container images.
It executes reproducible builds aligned with modern container standards and keeps images up to date.

Check out the [CLI Docs](../cli-plugins/build-service/overview.hbs.md) for more info about the Build Service plugin for Tanzu CLI.
