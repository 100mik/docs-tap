# Apps CLI plug-in overview

This Tanzu CLI plug-in provides the ability to create, view, update, and delete application workloads on any Kubernetes cluster that has the Tanzu Application Platform components installed.

## <a id='About'></a>About workloads

Tanzu Application Platform enables developers to quickly build and test applications regardless of their familiarity with Kubernetes.
Developers can turn source code into a workload that runs in a container with a URL.

A workload enables developers to choose application specifications, such as repository location, environment variables, service binding, and more.
For more information on workload creation and management, see [Command Reference](command-reference.md).

Tanzu Application Platform can support a range of workloads, including a serverless process that starts on demand, a constellation of microservices that functions as a logical application, or a small hello-world test app.

Follow the instructions to [Install or update the Tanzu CLI and plug-ins](../../install-general.md#cli-and-plugin).

From the `$HOME/tanzu` directory, run:

```
tanzu plugin install --local ./cli apps
```

To verify that the CLI is installed correctly, run:

```
tanzu apps version
```
A version should be displayed in the output.

If the following error is displayed during installation:
```
Error: could not find plug-in "apps" in any known repositories

âœ–  could not find plug-in "apps" in any known repositories
```

Verify that there is an `apps` entry in the `cli/manifest.yaml` file. It should look like this:
