# Opt out of telemetry collection

There are two components to telemetry collection in Tanzu Application Platform under VMwareâ€™s Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP): (1) the standard CEIP telemetry collection, and (2)  Pendo telemetry fom Tanzu Application Platform GUI. Each telemetry component has its own opt in/opt out process. The CEIP telemetry opt out decision can be made at an organizational level, whereas the decision regarding the Pendo telemetry is available both on an organizational level and an individual user level.

This topic describes how to opt out of the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) and out of Pendo telemetry on an organizational level. By default, when you install Tanzu Application Platform, both standard CEIP and Pendo telemetry are on by default. 

If you opt out of standard CEIP telemetry collection, VMware cannot offer you proactive support and the other benefits that accompany participation in the CEIP.

## <a id="turn-off"></a> Turn off standard CEIP telemetry collection

To turn off CEIP telemetry collection, follow the instructions below.
To deactivate Pendo telemetry collection, see
[Enable or deactivate the Pendo telemetry for the organization](#nbl-or-dsbl-pendo-for-org) later in the topic.

> **Note** If you decide to opt in to Pendo telemetry collection, each user is given the option to
> opt in or opt out. For more information, see
> [Opt in or opt out of Pendo telemetry for Tanzu Application Platform GUI](tap-portal-telemetry.hbs.md).


kubectl
: To turn off telemetry collection on Tanzu Application Platform by using kubectl:

   1. Ensure your Kubernetes context is pointing to the cluster where Tanzu Application Platform is
      installed.

   2. Run:

        ```console
        kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Namespace
        metadata:
          name: vmware-system-telemetry
        ---
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: ConfigMap
        metadata:
          namespace: vmware-system-telemetry
          name: vmware-telemetry-cluster-ceip
        data:
          level: disabled
        EOF
        ```

   3. If you already have Tanzu Application Platform installed, restart the telemetry collector to
      pick up the change:

        ```console
        kubectl delete pods --namespace tap-telemetry --all
        ```

Tanzu CLI
: The Tanzu CLI provides a telemetry plug-in enabled by the Tanzu Framework v0.25.0, which has been
  included in Tanzu Application Platform since v1.3.

  To turn off telemetry collection on your Tanzu Application Platform by using the Tanzu CLI, run:

    ```console
    tanzu telemetry update --CEIP-opt-out
    ```

  To learn more about how to update the telemetry settings, run:

    ```console
    tanzu telemetry update --help
    ```

At this point, your Tanzu Application Platform deployment no longer emits telemetry, and you have
opted out of the CEIP.

### <a id="nbl-or-dsbl-pendo-for-org"></a> Turn off Pendo telemetry collection

To enable Pendo telemetry for the organization, add the following parameters to your `tap-values.yaml`
file:

```yaml
tap_gui:
  app_config:
    pendoAnalytics:
      enabled: true
```

To deactivate the program for the entire organization, add the following parameters to your
`tap-values.yaml` file:
