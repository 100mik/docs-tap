## <a id='overview'></a> Overview of Tanzu Application Platform

<p class="note warning">
<strong>Warning:</strong> Tanzu Application Platform is currently in 
    beta and is intended for evaluation and test purposes.
</p>

Tanzu Application Platform is a packaged set of components that helps developers and operators 
build, deploy, and manage apps on Kubernetes.

Simplify workflows in both the _inner loop_ and _outer loop_ of Kubernetes-based app development with 
Tanzu Application Platform.

* **Inner Loop**: 
    - The inner loop describes a developerâ€™s personal development cycle of iterating on code. 
    - Inner loop activities include coding, testing, and debugging before making a commit.
    - On cloud-native or Kubernetes platforms, developers in the inner loop often 
    build container images and connect their app to all necessary services, apps, and 
    APIs to deploy it to a development environment.

* **Outer Loop**: 
    - The outer loop describes how operators deploy apps to production and maintain 
    them over time. 
    - On a cloud-native platform, outer loop activities include building container images, adding 
    container security, and configuring continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) 
    pipelines.
    - Outer loop activities are difficult in a Kubernetes-based development environment due to app 
    delivery platforms being constructed from various third-party and open source components  
    with numerous configuration options.

Tanzu Application Platform provides a default set of components that automates pushing an 
app to staging and production on Kubernetes, solving pains for both the inner loop and outer loop. 
Operators can customize the platform by replacing Tanzu Application Platform 
components with other products.

Reduce the complexity of deploying apps on Kubernetes for operators with better automation and 
standardization of the outer loop, giving developers more time to focus on code.
