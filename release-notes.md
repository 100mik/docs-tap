# Release notes

This topic contains release notes for Tanzu Application Platform v1.0.

## <a id='1-0'></a> v1.0

**Release Date**: MMMM DD, 2022

### Known issues

This release has the following issues:

#### Installing
When installing Tanzu Application Platform on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Kubernetes control plane can be unavailable for several minutes during the installation. Package installs can enter the `ReconcileFailed` state. When API server becomes available, packages try to reconcile to completion. This can happen on newly provisioned clusters which have not finished GKE API server autoscaling. When GKE scales up an API server, the current Tanzu Application install continues, and any subsequent installs succeed without interruption.

#### Application Accelerator
Build scripts provided as part of an accelerator do not have the execute bit set when a new project is generated from the accelerator. To resolve this issue, explicitly set the execute bit by using the "chmod" command: `chmod +x <build-script>`. For example, for a project generated from the "Spring PetClinic" accelerator, run: `chmod +x ./mvnw`.

#### Convention Service
Convention Service does not currently support custom certificates for integrating with a private registry. Support for custom certificates is planned for an upcoming release.

#### Supply Chain Choreographer
Deployment from a public Git repository might require a Git SSH secret. Workaround is to configure SSH access for the public Git repository.

#### Tanzu CLI

- **`tanzu apps workload get`:** Passing in `--output json` along with and the `--export` flag returns yaml rather than json. Support for honoring the `--output json` with `--export` will be added in the next release.
- **`tanzu apps workload create/update/apply`:** `--image` is not supported by the default supply chain in Tanzu Application Platform Beta 3 release. `--wait` functions as expected when a workload is created for the first time but may return prematurely on subsequent updates when passed with `workload update/apply` for existing workloads. When the `--wait` flag is included and you decline the "Do you want to create this workload?" prompt, the command continues to wait and must be cancelled manually.

#### Supply Chain Security Tools â€“ Scan

- **Failing Blob source scans:** Blob Source Scans have an edge case where, when a compressed file without a `.git` directory is provided, sending results to the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store fails and the scanned revision value is not set. The current workaround is to add the `.git` directory to the compressed file.
- **Events show `SaveScanResultsSuccess` incorrectly:** `SaveScanResultsSuccess` appears in the events when the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store is not configured. The `.status.conditions` output, however, correctly reflects `SendingResults=False`.
- **Scan Phase indicates `Scanning` incorrectly:** Scans have an edge case where, when an error has occurred during scanning, the Scan Phase field does not get updated to `Error` and instead remains in the `Scanning` phase. Read the scan Pod logs to verify there was an error.
- **CVE print columns are not getting populated:** After running a scan and using `kubectl get` on the scan, the CVE print columns (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, UNKNOWN, CVETOTAL) are not getting populated.

#### Grype scanner
**Scanning Java source code may not reveal vulnerabilities:** Source Code Scanning only scans files present in the source code repository.
  - No network calls are made to fetch dependencies.
  - For languages that make use of dependency lock files, such as Golang and Node.js, Grype uses the lock
  files to check the dependencies for vulnerabilities.
  In the case of Java, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype instead uses the dependencies
  present in the built binaries (`.jar` or `.war` files).
  - Because best practices do not include committing binaries to source code repositories, Grype fails to
  find vulnerabilities during a Source Scan. The vulnerabilities are still found during the Image Scan,
  after the binaries are built and packaged as images.

#### Supply Chain Security Tools - Store
- **CrashLoopBackOff from password authentication failed**
  - Symptom:

    Supply Chain Security Tools - Store does not start up. You see the following error in the `metadata-store-app` Pod logs:

    ```
    $ kubectl logs pod/metadata-store-app-* -n metadata-store -c metadata-store-app
    ...
    [error] failed to initialize database, got error failed to connect to `host=metadata-store-db user=metadata-store-user database=metadata-store`: server error (FATAL: password authentication failed for user "metadata-store-user" (SQLSTATE 28P01))
    ```

  - Solution:
    - If you see the error above, you have changed the database password between deployments, which is not
    supported. To change the password, see
    [Persistent Volume Retains Data](#persistent-volume-retains-data) below.
    > **Warning:** Changing the database password deletes your Supply Chain Security Tools - Store data.

- **Persistent volume retains data**
  - Symptom:
    - If Supply Chain Security Tools - Store is deployed, deleted, and then redeployed the
    `metadata-store-db` Pod fails to start up if the database password changed during redeployment.
    This is due to the persistent volume used by postgres retaining old data, even though the retention
    policy is set to `DELETE`.
  - Solution:
    - To redeploy the app either use the same database password or follow the steps below to erase the
    data on the volume:

      1. Deploy metadata-store app through kapp.
      1. Verify that the `metadata-store-db-*` Pod fails.
      1. Run:

          ```
          kubectl exec -it metadata-store-db-<some-id> -n metadata-store /bin/bash
          ```
          Where `<some-id>` is the ID generated by Kubernetes and appended to the Pod name.
      1. Run `rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data/*` to delete all database data.
      This is the path found in `postgres-db-deployment.yaml`.
      1. Delete the `metadata-store` app through kapp.
      1. Deploy the `metadata-store` app through kapp.
      
- **Missing persistent volume**
  - Symptom:
    - After Store is deployed, `metadata-store-db` Pod could fail for missing volume while
      `postgres-db-pv-claim` pvc is in `PENDING` state.
      This issue could be occurring because the cluster where Store is deployed does not have
      `storageclass` defined.
      `storageclass`'s provisioner is responsible for creating the persistent volume after
      `metadata-store-db` attaches `postgres-db-pv-claim`.
  - Solution:

    1. Verify that your cluster has `storageclass` by running `kubectl get storageclass`.
    1. Create a `storageclass` in your cluster before deploying Store, for example:

        ```
        # This is the storageclass that Kind uses
        kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/master/deploy/local-path-storage.yaml
          
        # set the storage class as default
        kubectl patch storageclass local-path -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
        ```
        
- **Querying local path source reports**
  - Symptom:
    - If a source report has a local path as the name -- for example, `/path/to/code` -- the leading `/`
    on the resulting repository name causes the querying packages and vulnerabilities to return the
    following error from the client lib and the CLI: `{ "message": "Not found" }`.
    - The URL of the resulting HTTP request is properly escaped: for example,
    `/api/sources/%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fdir/vulnerabilities`.
    - The rbac-proxy used for authentication handles this URL in a way that the response is a redirect:
    for example, `HTTP 301\nLocation: /api/sources/path/to/dir/vulnerabilities`.
    The Client Lib follows the redirect, making a request to the new URL which does not exist in the
    Supply Chain Security Tools - Store API, resulting in the error message above.
- **No support for installing in custom namespaces**
  - All of our testing uses the `metadata-store` namespace.
  Using a different namespace breaks authentication and certificate validation for the metadata-store API.

#### Supply Chain Security Tools - Sign

- If all webhook nodes or Pods are evicted by the cluster or scaled down, the admission policy blocks any Pods from being created in the cluster. To resolve the issue, delete the MutatingWebhookConfiguration and reapply it when the cluster is stable.

- **MutatingWebhookConfiguration prevents pods from being admitted:** Under certain circumstances, if the `image-policy-controller-manager` deployment

>>>>>>> a9b4433341b040f05a50b3150d849f185603c4e2
pods do not start up before the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` is applied to the
cluster, it can prevent the admission of all Pods.

  - For example, Pods can be prevented from starting if nodes in a cluster are
  scaled to zero and the webhook is forced to restart at the same time as
  other system components. A deadlock can occur when some components expect the
  webhook to verify their image signatures and the webhook is not running yet.

  - There is a known race condition during Tanzu Application Platform profiles
  installation that could cause this issue to happen.

  - **Symptoms:**

    You may see a message similar to one of the following in component statuses:

    ```
    Events:
      Type     Reason            Age                   From                   Message

      Warning  FailedCreate      4m28s                 replicaset-controller  Error creating: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "image-policy-webhook.signing.apps.tanzu.vmware.com": Post "https://image-policy-webhook-service.image-policy-system.svc:443/signing-policy-check?timeout=10s": no endpoints available for service "image-policy-webhook-service"
    ```

    ```
    Events:
      Type     Reason            Age                   From                   Message
      ----     ------            ----                  ----                   -------
      Warning FailedCreate 10m replicaset-controller Error creating: Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "image-policy-webhook.signing.apps.tanzu.vmware.com": Post "https://image-policy-webhook-service.image-policy-system.svc:443/signing-policy-check?timeout=10s": service "image-policy-webhook-service" not found
    ```

  - **Solution:**
    By deleting the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` resource, you can resolve the
    deadlock and enable the system to start up again. Once the system is stable,
    you can restore the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` resource to re-enable image
    signing enforcement.

    > **Important**: the steps below will temporarily disable signature verification
    > in your cluster.

    To do so:

    1. Backup the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` to a file by running the following
    command:
        ```
        kubectl get MutatingWebhookConfiguration image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration -o yaml > image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration.yaml
        ```

    2. Delete the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`:
        ```
        kubectl delete MutatingWebhookConfiguration image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration
        ```

    3. Wait until all components are up and running in your cluster, including the
    `image-policy-controller-manager` pods (namespace `image-policy-system`).

    4. Re-apply the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`:
        ```
        kubectl apply -f image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration.yaml
        ```

**Priority class of webhook's pods may preempt less privileged pods:**
This component uses a privileged `PriorityClass` to start up its pods in order
to prevent node pressure from preempting its pods. However, this can cause other
less privileged components to have their pods preempted or evicted instead.

  - **Symptoms:**

    You will see events similar to this in the output of `kubectl get events`:

    ```
    $ kubectl get events
    LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON             OBJECT               MESSAGE
    28s         Normal    Preempted          pod/testpod          Preempted by image-policy-system/image-policy-controller-manager-59dc669d99-frwcp on node test-node
    ```
  - **Solution:**
    - **Reduce the amount of pods deployed by the Sign component:**
    In case your deployment of the Sign component is running more pods than
    necessary, you may scale the deployment down. To do so:

        1. Create a values file called `scst-sign-values.yaml` with the following
        contents:
            ```
            ---
            replicas: N
            ```
            where N should be the smallest amount of pods you can have for your current
            cluster configuration.

        1. Apply your new configuration by running:
            ```
            tanzu package installed update image-policy-webhook \
              --package-name image-policy-webhook.signing.apps.tanzu.vmware.com \
              --version 1.0.0-beta.3 \
              --namespace tap-install \
              --values-file scst-sign-values.yaml
            ```

        1. It may take a few minutes until your configuration takes effect in the cluster.

    - **Increase your cluster's resources:**
      - Node pressure may be caused by not enough nodes or not enough resources on nodes
      for deploying the workloads you have. In this case, follow your cloud provider
      instructions on how to scale out or scale up your cluster.

#### Application Live View
The Live View section in Tanzu Application Platform GUI might show "No live information for pod with ID" after deploying Tanzu Application Platform workloads. Resolve this issue by recreating the Application Live View Connector pod. This allows the connector to discover the application instances and render the details in Tanzu Application Platform GUI. For example:

```
kubectl -n app-live-view delete pods -l=name=application-live-view-connector
```

#### Learning Center
- **Training Portal in pending state:** Under certain circumstances, the training portal will be stuck in a pending state; the best way to know the issue
this is to view the operator logs. In order to get the logs, you can execute:

```
kubectl logs deployment/learningcenter-operator -n learningcenter
```

  - Depending on the log, the issue may be:
    - TLS secret tls is not available. The TLS secret should be on the Learning Center operator namespace; otherwise, you will get this error:

    ```
    ERROR:kopf.objects:Handler 'learningcenter' failed temporarily: TLS secret tls is not available
    ```

  - Solution: To recover from this issue, you can follow [these steps](../getting-started/learningcenter-operator.md#enforcing-secure-connections)
to create the TLS Secret, once the TLS is created **you need to redeploy the TrainingPortal resource.**

- **image-policy-webhook-service not found** If you are installing a TAP profile, perhaps you are going to get this error.

  ```
  Internal error occurred: failed calling webhook "image-policy-webhook.signing.apps.tanzu.vmware.com": failed to call webhook: Post "https://image-policy-webhook-service.image-policy-system.svc:443/signing-policy-check?timeout=10s": service "image-policy-webhook-service" not found
  ```

  - Solution: This is a race condition error among some packages; to recover from this error you only need to redeploy the trainingPortal resource.

- **Updating parameters don't work**
  - Normally you will need to update some parameters provided to the Learning Center Operator (E.g. ingressDomain, TLS secret, ingressClass etc);
  depending the way you used to change the values, you can execute these commands to validate if the parameters were changed:

  ```
  kubectl describe systemprofile
  ```
  or
  ```
  kubectl describe pod  -n learningcenter
  ```

  - But the Training Portals don't work or get the updated values.

  - Solution: By design, the Training Portal resources will not react to any changes on the parameters provided when the training portals were created.
  This is because any change on the trainingportal resource will affect any online user who is running a workshop.
  To get the new values, you will need to redeploy the trainingportal in a maintenance window where learning center is unavailable while the systemprofile gets updated.

- **Increase your cluster's resources**
  - Node pressure may be caused by not enough nodes or not enough resources on nodes
  for deploying the workloads you have. In this case, follow your cloud provider
  instructions on how to scale out or scale up your cluster.

### Security issues

This release has the following security issues:

* The installation specifies that the installer's Tanzu Network credentials be exported to all namespaces. Customers can optionally choose to mitigate this concern using one of the following methods:
  *  Create a Tanzu Network account with their own credentials and use this for the installation exclusively.
  *  Using [Carvel tool's imgpkg](https://carvel.dev/imgpkg/) customers can create a dedicated OCI registry on their own infrastructure that can comply with any required security policies that may exist.
* Security issue 2

### Breaking changes

This release has the following breaking changes:

- **Supply Chain Security Tools - Store:** Changed package name to `metadata-store.apps.tanzu.vmware.com`.

### Bug fixes

### Known issues

This release has the following issues:

#### Installing

- When installing Tanzu Application Platform on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Kubernetes control plane may be unavailable for several minutes during the install. Package installs can enter the ReconcileFailed state. When API server becomes available, packages try to reconcile to completion.
  - This can happen on newly provisioned clusters which have not gone through GKE API server autoscaling. When GKE scales up an API server, the current Tanzu Application install continues, and any subsequent installs succeed without interruption.

#### Convention Service

Convention Service does not currently support self-signed certificates for integrating with a private registry. Support for self-signed certificates is planned for an upcoming release.

#### Supply Chain Security Tools - Sign

- If all webhook nodes or Pods are evicted by the cluster or scaled down,
the admission policy blocks any Pods from being created in the cluster.
  - To resolve the issue, delete the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` and reapply it when the cluster is stable.
- **MutatingWebhookConfiguration prevents pods from being admitted**
  - Under certain circumstances, if the `image-policy-controller-manager` deployment
    pods do not start up before the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration` is applied to the
    cluster, it can prevent the admission of all pods.
  - For example, pods can be prevented from starting if nodes in a cluster are
    scaled to zero and the webhook is forced to restart at the same time as
    other system components. A deadlock can occur when some components expect the
    webhook to verify their image signatures and the webhook is not running yet.
  - Symptoms
    - You will see a message similar to the following in your `ReplicaSet` statuses:

    ```
    Events:
      Type     Reason            Age                   From                   Message

          kubectl get MutatingWebhookConfiguration image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration -o yaml > image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration.yaml
          ```

      1. Delete the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`:
          ```
          kubectl delete MutatingWebhookConfiguration image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration
          ```

      1. Wait until all components are up and running in your cluster, including the
      `image-policy-controller-manager` pods (namespace `image-policy-system`).

      1. Re-apply the `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`:
          ```
          kubectl apply -f image-policy-mutating-webhook-configuration.yaml
          ```
- **Priority class of webhook's pods may preempt less privileged pods**
  - This component uses a privileged `PriorityClass` to start up its pods in order
  to prevent node pressure from preempting its pods. However, this can cause other
  less privileged components to have their pods preempted or evicted instead.
  - Symptoms
    - You will see events similar to this in the output of `kubectl get events`:

      ```
      $ kubectl get events
      LAST SEEN   TYPE      REASON             OBJECT               MESSAGE
      28s         Normal    Preempted          pod/testpod          Preempted by image-policy-system/image-policy-controller-manager-59dc669d99-frwcp on node test-node
      ```

  - Solution
    - Reduce the amount of pods deployed by the Sign component
    - In case your deployment of the Sign component is running more pods than
    necessary, you may scale the deployment down. To do so:

      1. Create a values file called `scst-sign-values.yaml` with the following
      contents:
      ```
      ---
      replicas: N
      ```
      where N should be the smallest amount of pods you can have for your current
      cluster configuration

      1. Apply your new configuration by running:
      ```
      tanzu package installed update image-policy-webhook \
        --package-name image-policy-webhook.signing.run.tanzu.vmware.com \
        --version 1.0.0-beta.2 \
        --namespace tap-install \
        --values-file scst-sign-values.yaml
      ```

      1. It may take a few minutes until your configuration takes effect in the cluster.

    - Increase your cluster's resources
      - Node pressure may be caused by not enough nodes or not enough resources on nodes
      for deploying the workloads you have. In this case, follow your cloud provider
      instructions on how to scale out or scale up your cluster.

#### Tanzu CLI apps plug-in  

- **`tanzu apps workload get`**
  - Passing in `--output json` along with and the `--export` flag returns yaml rather than json. Support for honoring the `--output json` with `--export` will be added in the next release.
- **`tanzu apps workload create/update/apply`**
  - `--image` is not supported by the default supply chain in Tanzu Application Platform Beta 3 release.
  - `--wait` functions as expected when a workload is created for the first time but may return prematurely on subsequent updates when passed with `workload update/apply` for existing workloads.
    - When the `--wait` flag is included and you decline the "Do you want to create this workload?" prompt, the command continues to wait and must be cancelled manually.

#### Supply Chain Security Tools â€“ Scan

- **Failing Blob source scans:** Blob Source Scans have an edge case where, when a compressed file without a `.git` directory is
provided, sending results to the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store fails and the scanned revision
value is not set. The current workaround is to add the `.git` directory to the compressed file.
- **Events show `SaveScanResultsSuccess` incorrectly:** `SaveScanResultsSuccess` appears in the events when the Supply Chain Security Tools - Store is not
configured. The `.status.conditions` output, however, correctly reflects `SendingResults=False`.
- **Scan Phase indicates `Scanning` incorrectly:** Scans have an edge case where, when an error has occurred during scanning, the Scan Phase field does
not get updated to `Error` and instead remains in the `Scanning` phase.
Read the scan Pod logs to verify that there was an error.

### Known limitations with Grype scanner

- **Supply Chain Security Tools â€“ Scan**
  - Scanning Java source code may not reveal vulnerabilities:
    - Source Code Scanning only scans files present in the source code repository. No network calls are made to fetch dependencies.
    - For languages that make use of dependency lock files, such as Golang and Node.js, Grype uses the lock
    files to check the dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    In the case of Java, dependency lock files are not guaranteed, so Grype instead uses the dependencies
    present in the built binaries (`.jar` or `.war` files).
    - Because best practices do not include committing binaries to source code repositories, Grype fails to
    find vulnerabilities during a Source Scan. The vulnerabilities are still found during the Image Scan,
    after the binaries are built and packaged as images.  

### Bug Fixes

#### Tanzu Dev Tools for VSCode
- Added a "wait" service which prevents user from using the live update & debug capabilities until the deployment is up & running on the cluster. Fixes known issue from TAP 0.2.0 & 0.3.0.

### Known issues

This release has the following issues:

- **Image Policy Webhook:** If all webhook nodes or Pods are evicted by the cluster or scaled down, the admission policy blocks any Pods from being created in the cluster. To resolve the issue, the administrator needs to kubectl delete the Image Policy Webhook and reapply it once the cluster is stable.
- When you use the `Tanzu Developer Tools for VSCode` extension, delete the workload before performing any of the following actions. This will avoid workload update errors.
    - Switching between the `Live Update` & `Debug` capabilities
    - Disabling `Live Update` & re-starting `Live Update`

    You can do so by performing the following steps:
    1. Click the `Terminal` menu and select the `Run Task` option
    2. Type `tanzuWorkload delete` in the command palette that appears and hit enter
    3. View the Terminal tab to confirm that the Workload has been deleted

- Tanzu App CLI plug-in:
  - *`tanzu apps workload get`*: passing in `--output json` along with and the `--export` flag will return YAML rather than JSON (support for honoring the `--output json` in conjunction with `--export` will be added in the next release).
  - *`tanzu apps workload create/update/apply`*: when the `--wait` flag has been included and the "Do you want to create this workload?" prompt is declined, the command continues to wait rather exit
- **Tanzu CLI apps plug-in**
  - **`tanzu apps workload get`**
    - Passing in `--output json` along with and the `--export` flag returns yaml rather than json. Support for honoring the `--output json` with `--export` will be added in the next release.
  - **`tanzu apps workload create/update/apply`**
    - `--image` is not supported by the default supply chain in Tanzu Application Platform Beta 3 release.
    - `--wait` functions as expected when a workload is created for the first time but may return prematurely on subsequent updates when passed with `workload update/apply` for existing workloads.
      - When the `--wait` flag is included and you decline the "Do you want to create this workload?" prompt, the command continues to wait and must be cancelled manually.

### Security issues

This release has the following security issue:

#### Learning Center

- In Learning Center, exported registry credentials are visible across namespaces.
Because SecretExport CR allows you to export registry credentials to other namespaces, they are
visible to users of those namespaces.
VMware recommends that the registry credentials you export give read-only access to the registry and
have minimal scope within the registry.

### Bug Fixes

#### Tanzu Dev Tools for VSCode  

- Bug fix in the Tanzu: Live Update Stop command that was not properly calling the stop task

### Breaking Changes

This release has the following breaking changes:

#### Supply Chain Security Tools - Store**

- (possibly breaking) `storageClassName` and `databaseRequestStorage` fields have been changed to `storage_class_name` and `database_request_storage` respectively. This change was made to keep the format of all available fields consistent with other available fields.
- (possibly breaking) Change output for unhappy paths to be more consistent. Empty results due to sources not existing when searching by package or source information now returns an empty array with a 200 response. Previously it would give an error JSON with a 404.
